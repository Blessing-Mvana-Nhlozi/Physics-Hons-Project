# Physics-Hons-Project
It is beneficial to construct a model that will aid in the development of ways to analyze a system qualitatively or quantitatively in any study. The goal of this research was to create a system that imitated physical adsorption on the surface of Metal Oxide gas sensors from the ground up. A mathematical expression was developed that relates time to the amount of adsorbed gas molecules. Python &amp; Excel was used to create a simulation environment. The findings were compared to experimental data from the literature.
