#### Abstract

It is beneficial to construct a model that will aid in the development of ways to analyze a system qualitatively or quantitatively in any study. The goal of this research was to create a system that imitated physical adsorption on the surface of Metal Oxide gas sensors from the ground up. A mathematical expression was developed that relates time to the amount of adsorbed gas molecules. Python was used to create a simulation environment. The findings were compared to experimental data from the literature.

#### Problem Statement

One of the most appealing areas of research in the domain of gas sensing is gas identification. The detection limit and sensitivity of sensors for specific chemical molecule, namely the invention and implementation of sensors to precisely detect a pollutant, are usually crucial in the research of gas detection by semiconductor sensors. Sensors that selectively respond with certain chemical molecules have yet to be produced, although mixed gas sensors always yield a signal. Thus, uplifting the concern for researchers to seek for solutions. Therefore, simulating a conductivity of a semiconductor gas sensor from first principle to determine gas types and their concentrations.

#### Purpose
The purpose of simulating is to figure out how the process of gas detection works via relative conductivity signal. It gives a useful way of analysis that is simple to verify, discuss, and comprehend. Simulation modelling delivers valuable solutions across sectors and disciplines by providing clear insights into complicated systems.
